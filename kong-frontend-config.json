    "---\n> [!WARNING]\n> #### Moved preset: `Kong/public-shared-renovate:kong-frontend-config`\n>\n> Renovate identified that this repository currently references this deprecated/moved preset. To avoid disruptions, this preset now acts as a temporary compatibility alias.\n>\n> It has been relocated to `Kong/public-shared-renovate//base/frontend`.\n>\n> #### Recommended path\n>\n> Use the default preset:\n>\n> ```json\n> { \"extends\": [\"Kong/public-shared-renovate\"] }\n> ```\n>\n> #### Customize or restore behavior\n>\n> If you would like to restore configuration that changed as part of the rethinking and standardizing process, or if you want to adjust settings (for example, the timezone), you can layer overrides on top of the default preset. Example:\n>\n> ```json\n> {\n>   \"extends\": [\n>     \"Kong/public-shared-renovate\",\n>     \"Kong/public-shared-renovate//helpers/disable-action(Kong/kong-api-tests)\",\n>     \"Kong/public-shared-renovate//helpers/disable-action(the-actions-org/workflow-dispatch)\",\n>     \":noUnscheduledUpdates\",\n>     \":timezone(America/New_York)\",\n>     \"schedule:automergeWeekdays\",\n>     \"schedule:daily\"\n>   ],\n>   \"addLabels\": [\"renovate-bot\"]\n> }\n> ```\n>\n> #### Timeline\n>\n> This alias will be removed in **January 2026**.\n"
