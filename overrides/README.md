# Overrides presets

Overrides are small, composable tweaks you can layer onto any Consumer repository or higher‑level preset. They are intentionally narrow and opt‑in. Typical use cases include adding labels, requesting reviewers, or adjusting behavior for a well‑defined subset of updates.

They live alongside broadly reusable building blocks in [base/](../base) and urgent org‑wide mitigations in [security-incidents/](../security-incidents).
